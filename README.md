# Installation guide

This repository contains the developed architectures in the research of attention mechanisms as feature selectors.

Currently, not all architectures are available. This packages will be updated in the future (I hope that).

The code here is developed as a python package, pitifully it is not available in PyPi yet :disappointed:. Anyway, a magic makefile is included (for your comfort :wink:), and some specifications are included below.


## Building the package

To build the package you just need to run:

```
make
```

or: 

```
make build
```

## Installing the package

To install the package just execute:

```
make install
```

## Running tests

To run the included tests just execute

```
make run_tests
```

If you want to add more tests don't forget to add them in the makefile.

Easy, right? :sunglasses:
